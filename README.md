- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rg3h. I've worked at google, tableau, NASA, PARC, HP, IBM, SGI, and a successful start up.


- âœ¨ My Ph.D. is in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), specifically realtime interactive 3D graphics. I have worked on many different projects including information interaction, data visualization, VR/AR, retail of the future, mobile devices, television, interactive public displays, travel, genetics, and healthcare. I've launched products, run labs, worked on a Mars mission, had my work presented at google I/O and google all hands.


- ðŸ‘€ I enjoy rapid prototyping and collaborating on small teams. Iâ€™m currently working on a "next web" model for information gathering, organizing, presenting and sharing (GOPS). I am interested in challenging problems using novel human-centric approaches, then prototyping and iterating to continuously improve as we learn. I've researched, developed, and launched a number of products using this. Plus it is a lot of fun.


- ðŸ“« Happy to talk more if you are interested in challenging problems (e.g. climate change, the next web, healthcare, AR, creative designs, etc).

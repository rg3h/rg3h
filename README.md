- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rg3h. I am a mad scientist. I've worked at google, tableau, NASA (Mars mission!), Xerox PARC, and a successful start up.


- âœ¨ My Ph.D. is in realtime interactive 3D graphics and HCI. I have worked on a lot of projects including information interaction, data visualization, VR/AR, phones, television, travel, genetics, and healthcare. I've launched products, run labs, worked on a Mars mission and had work presented at Google I/O. 


- ðŸ‘€ I write mostly javascript, enjoy rapid prototyping and collaborating on small teams. Iâ€™m currently interested in developing human-centric AR applications, new information models, data visualizations, and generally collaborating on new ideas.


- ðŸ“« Sleuth out my email if you want to talk.

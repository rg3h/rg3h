- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rg3h. I am a mad scientist. I've worked at google, NASA (Mars mission), Xerox PARC, and a successful start up.
- âœ¨ My background is in HCI/UX, information interaction, data visualization, front end engineering, system architecture.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AR, data visualizations, and generally discussing/collaborating on interesting problems.
- ðŸ“« Find my email and say hi if you want to talk about AR or an interesting problem (e.g. climate change, feeding people, better healthcare, robots!).

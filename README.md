- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rg3h. I've worked at google X, google research, tableau, NASA (Mars mission!), Xerox PARC, HP, IBM, and a successful start up.


- âœ¨ My Ph.D. is in realtime interactive 3D graphics and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). I have worked on a lot of projects including information interaction, data visualization, VR/AR, retail of the future, mobile devices, television, interactive public displays, travel, genetics, and healthcare. I've launched products, run labs, worked on a Mars mission, Google all hands and google I/O. 


- ðŸ‘€ I enjoy rapid prototyping and collaborating on small teams. Iâ€™m currently working on a "next web" model for information collaboration. It is focused on getting beyond the impoverished state the web is in today. I am generally interested in addressing challenging problems using human-centric and novel approaches, then rapid prototyping and iterating to hone their potential. I've researched, developed, and launched a number of products.


- ðŸ“« Happy to talk more if you are interested in my work or any challenging problem (e.g. climate change, the next web, healthcare, AR, creative designs, etc).

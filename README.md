- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rg3h. I've worked at google, tableau, NASA, PARC, HP, IBM, SGI, and a successful start up.


- âœ¨ My Ph.D. is in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and realtime interactive 3D graphics. I have worked on many different projects including information interaction, data visualization, VR/AR, retail of the future, mobile devices, television, interactive public displays, travel, genetics, and healthcare. I've launched products, run labs, worked on a Mars mission, had my work presented at google I/O and at google all hands.


- ðŸ‘€ I enjoy rapid prototyping, tool-building, exploring, designing, and building future human-centered architectures. I've researched, developed, and launched a number of products using this rapid experiment-and-iterate methodology. 


- ðŸ“« Happy to talk about interesting/challenging/better futures in human-computer technology!

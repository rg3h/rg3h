- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m rich gossweiler (@rg3h). I've worked at google, tableau, NASA, Xerox PARC, HP, IBM, SGI, and a successful start up.


- âœ¨ My area of expertise is in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and realtime interactive 3D graphics. I have worked on many different projects including information interaction, data visualization, News, YouTube, VR/AR, retail of the future, mobile devices, television, interactive public displays, travel, genetics, and healthcare. I've launched products, run labs, and even worked on a Mars mission.


- ðŸ‘€ I enjoy rapid prototyping, tool-building, and exploring the future by designing and building human-centered architectures.


- ðŸ“« I'm happy to talk about all things in science. I used to surf, so that's fun to talk about too!
